# Python Learn and Practice

A series of Python and Quarto Markdown files with Python code for practicing the versatile programming language.

## Description

Python is the most popular programming language in the world thanks to it being open-source and so versatile. I'm continually working to improve my Python skills and familiarize myself
with its associated packages. From Pandas to Polars, MatPlotLib to Seaborn, SciKitLearn to Tensorflow; eventually, I'll get to it all.

Within this repository you'll find Python and Quarto Markdown files with Python code demonstrating my application thereof and its associated packages.
