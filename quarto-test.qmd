## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more
- Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{r}
# Generate a random vector of numbers
random_vector <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 100)

# Print the vector
print(random_vector)

# Calculate the mean of the vector
mean_value <- mean(random_vector)
cat("Mean value:", mean_value, "\n")

# Plot a histogram of the vector
hist(random_vector, main = "Histogram of Random Numbers", xlab = "Value", ylab = "Frequency")

```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
